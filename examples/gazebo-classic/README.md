# Gazebo Classic Example

This example demonstrates how to use maps generated by ROS GridMap Generator with Gazebo Classic and ROS Noetic.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have exported map files from the main application to `../shared/maps/`
2. Build and run the container:

```bash
# Build the image
docker-compose build gazebo-classic

# Run the container
docker-compose run --rm gazebo-classic
```

## Available Commands

Once inside the container, you can run:

### Launch SDF World Only
```bash
roslaunch /workspace/launch/test_world.launch
```
This loads the generated `world_classic.sdf` file with a TurtleBot3 robot.

### Launch with Map Server
```bash
roslaunch /workspace/launch/test_map.launch
```
This loads both the SDF world and the map server with the generated `map_ros1.yaml` file, plus RViz for visualization.

### Manual Map Server
```bash
rosrun map_server map_server /workspace/maps/map_ros1.yaml
```

## Required Files

Make sure these files exist in `../shared/maps/`:
- `world_classic.sdf` - Generated Gazebo Classic world
- `map_ros1.yaml` - ROS1 format map configuration
- `map.pgm` - Map image file

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Not Showing
Make sure X11 forwarding is enabled:
```bash
xhost +local:docker
```

### TurtleBot3 Model Issues
The default model is set to 'burger'. Change it if needed:
```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
```
